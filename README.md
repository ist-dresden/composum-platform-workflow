## [Composum Platform Workflow](https://www.composum.com/home/platform/extensions/workflow.html)

The Composum Platform Workflow module is an extension within the Composum Platform that allows users to define and
manage collaborative processes. Workflows are composed of various tasks that are linked together, forming a flexible
workflow. These tasks can be assigned to specific users or groups and are displayed in the inbox view for assigned
users.

Workflows are defined as a combination of workflow tasks, which are repository nodes. Each task has data properties and
processing options. Manually steps in the workflow require user interaction and display a dialog with embedded forms for
selecting options. A workflow can be initiated by starting with a specific task template, and the workflow graph is
generated by following the available options until reaching the final tasks or repeating tasks. The calculated workflow
graph can be rendered and shown to visualize the workflow's progress. Users can manually start workflows, view pending
tasks in their inbox, process tasks, start new workflows, view status graphs, and cancel workflows. The workflow engine
in the Composum Platform supports internationalization, allowing for the configuration of different languages for each
step in the workflow. Sending emails is supported as part of a workflow.
